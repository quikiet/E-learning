  LearnSmart Policy and Enforcement Guidelines

<div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto p-6 my-10">
  <p class="left-to-right mb-4">
    At LearnSmart, we strive to maintain a safe and respectful community for all
    students and instructors.
  </p>
  <p class="left-to-right mb-4">
    Instructors are prohibited from posting lesson content that violates
    community guidelines or includes sensitive material. Any breach of this rule
    will initiate our enforcement process.
  </p>
  <p class="left-to-right mb-4">
    The escalation process for policy violations is designed to address
    non-compliance effectively:
  </p>
  <ol class="left-to-right list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 font-mono font-semibold">
    <li>
      First Violation (Warning) → Instructors receive an email notification from
      Trust & Safety detailing the violation and relevant policies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Second Violation (Strike 1) → If the same prohibited content is posted
      again after a warning, the offending course will be immediately locked,
      and the instructor’s account will be reviewed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Third Violation (Strike 2) → Permanent ban of the instructor’s account and
      all associated course materials from the LearnSmart platform.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="left-to-right mb-4">
    Violations are tracked at the course level, affecting all instructors and
    co-instructors associated with the course in question. We reserve the right
    to escalate penalties based on the severity of the violation or the
    instructor’s history.
  </p>
  <p class="left-to-right mb-4">
    Revenue sharing for instructors is as follows: Instructors receive
    <b class="font-mono"> 37%</b> of course revenue if learners do not use a
    coupon. If a coupon is applied, instructors earn
    <b class="font-mono"> 97%</b> of the revenue. We encourage instructors to
    promote their courses with their own coupons on external platforms to
    maximize earnings. Revenue will be disbursed monthly to the instructor’s
    PayPal email address.
  </p>
